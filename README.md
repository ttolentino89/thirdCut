"thirdCut" is a simple Node.js server-side JavaScript application that accepts user input in the form of a string sent to "/test", then returns a new string created from every third letter of the original input. Here it is in action below:

# Implementation + Testing :computer:

To run thirdCut on your machine, please enter the following commands in your terminal:

1.  ```git clone https://github.com/ttolentino89/thirdCut.git```
2.  ```cd thirdCut```
3.  ```npm i```
4.  ```npm start```

If you're not familiar with using the terminal or command line interface (CLI) on your computer, that's totally okay! There's a great tutorial on common CLI commands [here](https://blog.galvanize.com/how-to-use-the-terminal-command-line/) that I highly recommend for first-timers.

Because thirdCut is hosted and run locally, you will need a web API client and development environment such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which you can download for free [here](https://www.postman.com/). In fact, the example demo above shows this program being tested out in Postman, so you should have a good idea how it should look if all goes well  :+1:
